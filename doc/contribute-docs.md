# Contribute Documentation

## Reporting an issue

If you find any issue in Netplan's documentation please [file a bugreport](https://bugs.launchpad.net/netplan/+filebug?field.tags=documentation)
about it in our bugtracker at Launchpad. Remember adding a `documentation` tag
to it.

## Modifying documentation online

Each documentation page, rendered on the web contains an "Edit this page" at
the top-right of every page, besides the documentation title. Clicking this
button will lead you to the GitHub web-editor where you can easily propose
changes to the corresponding page.

Please remember to first check the [latest version](https://netplan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
of our documentation and make your proposal based on that revision.

## Creating a pull-request

If you want to follow a git development workflow, you can also checkout the
[Netplan repository](https://github.com/canonical/netplan) and contribute your
changes as [pull-requests](https://github.com/canonical/netplan/pulls), putting
the `documentation` label for better visibility.

Please see the `doc/` and `examples/` directories for relevant files.
